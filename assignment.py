"""
Class Method
Definition: A class method is a method that is bound to the class rather than its object. It can modify the class state that applies across all instances of the class.
Decorator: It is defined using the @classmethod decorator.
First Parameter: The first parameter is typically named cls, which refers to the class itself.


Static Method
Definition: A static method is a method that does not access or modify the class or instance state. It behaves like a regular function but lives in the class's namespace.
Decorator: It is defined using the @staticmethod decorator.
Parameters: It does not take self or cls as its first parameter.
